📸 Image Features Extraction with Machine Learning
🔍 Overview
This project explores various feature extraction techniques from images using Machine Learning and OpenCV. The extracted features can be used for object recognition, image matching, and similarity detection.

🚀 Features
ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) feature detection
SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for robust keypoint detection
Image matching using BFMatcher
Visualization of detected keypoints and matched features
Implementation in Python with OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib
